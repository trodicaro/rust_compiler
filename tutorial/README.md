I barely know Rust and last coded in it years ago.  I'm definitely 
need to refresh my memory.

In this directory, I'm going to work a series of very small
programming exercises on things that seem directly related to
some issues that will probably arise in the interpreter project. 
This includes, but is not limited to the following:

* How to read from files
* How to print
* Basic string/text manipulation 
* How to report errors and quit
* Optional results
* Defining new data structures
* Defining data structure variants
* Defining trees
* Pattern matching
* Hashmaps/dicts

It is *unlikely* that the interpreter project will involve any
of the following topics:

* Concurrency/Network
* Generics
* Unsafe Rust
* Macros
* Heavy mathematical calculations (vectors, matrices, etc.)
